# Demo Code done for TechEd 2014

This is the sample i used at TechEd 2014 using 
Certificates as the Authentication

Note that the Passworld in the Web.Config will need to
be changed to your private key password of YOUR self signed or
SSL Trustet Cert

Additionally you will need to change the Site URL in the Project Properties

cheers,
Fabian
